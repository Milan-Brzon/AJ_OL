I work in a restaurant in Madrid. I’m a waiter. I speak
English at work every day, because a lot of tourists
come here. I help customers with the menu and I say
what the special dishes are. They are very happy
because they can talk to me in English. A lot of
tourists don’t speak Spanish, but they usually speak
English.

Chris I like cooking alone. I don’t like having other
people in the kitchen. But I like eating with friends,
especially when I’m out. I don’t like being alone in a
restaurant.

Sarah I don’t like travelling alone - I prefer going on
holiday with friends. But they need to be the right
friends!

Mike I like shopping with friends. When I go alone
I usually buy things that look horrible on me. I need a
second opinion!

Greta I love dancing alone at home to really old
music from the 70s, like Abba. But I never dance with
other people at parties because I know I’m a terrible
dancer.

Veronica I like watching films with friends. When
the film finishes, we can talk about it, and I like
having someone with me so we can be happy or
frightened together!

Becca I like running alone. It helps me to
concentrate, and it’s very peaceful! But I prefer going
for walks with other people because I like walking
and talking.

Andy I like driving alone. I love listening to my
favourite music in the car and singing very loudly -
but with the windows closed of course!

## 9.10 / 56 - Undercover Boss

<audio src="./assets/EF1_4ed_SB__09_10.mp3"></audio>

Undercover Boss is a TV show where different
bosses work undercover. They want to know more
about their workers and about problems in their
companies. In Episode 1, David Clarke, the manager
of a big hotel chain, is working ‘undercover’ for a
week in one of his hotels.



## 9.11 / 56 - Episode 1 summary

<audio src="./assets/EF1_4ed_SB__09_11.mp3"></audio>

Monday
David says that he’s a new worker and that his name
is ‘Andy’. The other workers don’t know who he really
is. He usually wears a suit, but today he’s wearing
jeans and a T-shirt. He’s working in the kitchen - he’s
washing the dishes. The people in the kitchen usually
work 80 hours a week! One of the ovens is broken,
but David thinks that the food is good.

Tuesday
Today, he’s working in the bedrooms. Next week,
there is a hotel inspection. The workers are repairing
things that are broken, but only in the rooms for the
hotel inspector. They aren’t repairing things in the
other rooms. David isn’t happy about this, but he
can’t say anything.

Wednesday
Today, David is working in the restaurant. He’s
serving breakfast. He’s wearing a white jacket and a
hat. The waiters and waitresses always work very
hard.

Thursday
David is cleaning rooms. The workers only have a
quarter of an hour to clean a room. David is working
very hard. He’s very tired.

Visit Scotland
Scotland is one of the world’s top tourist destinations,
with 10,000 kilometres of coast, 790 islands, more
than 30,000 ‘lochs’ (the word in Scotland for lakes),
famous castles, and beautiful cities. There’s
something for visitors of all ages.

Why Loch Ness?
Loch Ness is 10 km south west of the city of
Inverness - perfect for day trips.
You can take a boat trip on the loch and visit the
Loch Ness Centre to find out all about ‘Nessie’, the
monster.
One of the most beautiful castles in the world,
Urquhart Castle, is on the banks of the loch.
There are wonderful places for walking and cycling
very near.

Accommodation
Stay at the Craigdarroch Inn. It’s the perfect place for
a great view of the loch.

We followed our dream
My wife and I always wanted to live abroad. But
Miriam and I both work in the UK - she’s a doctor
and I’m a designer - and we have two small children,
Sacha and Elena. Then an American university,
Duke in Durham, North Carolina, asked Miriam to go
and work there for a year. At first, we weren’t sure
what to do. There were so many questions. What
about Sacha’s school? What do we do with our
house? But finally, we decided to go!

At first living in the USA was quite difficult. We
missed our friends and family and we didn’t like the
food. It was difficult to find organic fruit and
vegetables. We also needed to rent a car. In London,
we don’t drive, but in Durham, not many people walk
or use public transport!
But we soon started to enjoy it. Our house was nice,
and near a lovely park. Sacha liked his school,
especially his music teacher, who played the trumpet!
He worked hard and his teachers were very happy
with him.

Miriam really liked her job - it was very interesting. I
worked from home, so I was with the children a lot
and I loved it. In general life was good. It was quite
cheap - cheaper than in the UK. We joined a sports
club, where the children learned to swim, and I
played a lot of tennis, one of my favourite sports.
The people in Durham were very friendly. They often
invited us to their homes. It was easy to meet people
at the sports club, or at the university where Miriam
worked. And there were so many new places to see!
At weekends we visited some of the beautiful
national parks. They were very different from English
parks! In one park there was a sign saying ‘don’t
disturb the snakes’ - Sacha loved it!

I also remember a trip to a country music festival at a
blueberry farm. It was fantastic. First we listened to
the music, and then we picked a lot of blueberries -
they’re Elena’s favourite fruit. But after that trip she
didn't want to eat a blueberry for at least two weeks!
We stayed in Durham for a year. After that we
returned to England, because my wife’s job finished.
But we loved our life in the USA, and we're thinking
of going back there in maybe two or three years.

Early in the morning in the USA, a baby opened his
eyes and looked at his mother. ‘Isn’t he pretty?’ she
asked the camera. Around the world, people got up,
and washed, and had breakfast. A 15-year-old boy
shaved for the first time. He didn’t enjoy it! A small
boy kissed his mother on her birthday.

The 24th of July was a Saturday, so a lot of people
didn’t go to work. They relaxed and went to the park

with their family, or went shopping. But other people
worked hard, or cooked and cleaned. Some children
played - but others worked. One small boy cleaned
shoes in the street. One woman went to hospital for
an operation. Another woman waited all evening to
talk to her husband on Skype. He was a soldier
thousands of miles from home.

For some people, the 24th of July was a special day.
A man arrived in Kathmandu. He was on a cycle trip
around the world. A woman did an incredible skydive
An unemployed man got his first job. A boy who was
at university went home to see his father for the first
time in three years. Another man asked his girlfriend
to marry him. A man and a woman got married and
had an incredible party.

This beautiful film shows us life around the world in
the 21st century. Watch it! It’s free on YouTube.

Strangers on a Train

Part 1
David When the train stopped at the station, I
opened my eyes and looked out of the
window. I saw a woman on the platform. She
was tall and blonde with blue eyes. The train
moved and I closed my eyes. It was 4.00
p.m. and the train was full.
Olivia Excuse me. Can I sit here?
David I opened my eyes again. It was the tall,
blonde woman. ‘Sure,’ I answered. She sat
down next to me. There was a nice smell.
Chanel Number 5. I started to listen to music
on my phone.

Olivia I love Chopin.
David ‘Sorry?’ I said.
Olivia You’re listening to Chopin. I love classical
music.
David She smiled. Her eyes were very blue. We
talked about music until the train arrived at
Paddington Station.
Olivia ‘Would you like a cup of coffee?’
David she asked me. I looked at my watch. ‘OK’, I
said. ‘I have time.’

David Olivia's car was in the station car park.
David Nice car! I said
David It was a big BMW. She was a very fast
driver. She stopped outside my flat. We said
good-bye and exchanged phone numbers.

The next morning, there was a message
from Olivia. She wrote:
Olivia I really want to see you again! Friday?
David On Friday morning, Olivia phoned me. Hello.
